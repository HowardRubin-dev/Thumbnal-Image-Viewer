Building Thumbnal-Image-Viewer
Requires Qt
The include 'build' shell script should run successfully

Running
Running from the GUI may fail silently. If so, run from the command line which will report that
libQt5PrintSupport.so.5 is missing.  Synaptic should install this by installing libQt5PrintSupport

You can overcome this by switching to CMYK by editing your printer's /etc/cups/ppd/<printer name>.ppd as instructed here:

Then CMYK should be available in Printer Properties > Printer Options > Color Model
